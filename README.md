# Overlap of symptoms in DSM-5, restricted to Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders (Chapter 2), Bipolar and Related Disorders (Chapter 3) and Depressive Disorders (Chapter 4)

* Using data from supplementary of [Forbes et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291723002544) I created a similar figure but restricted to Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders (Chapter 2), Bipolar and Related Disorders (Chapter 3) and Depressive Disorders (Chapter 4).

## Overlap in diagnostic chapters

Each node is a symptom. Purple nodes are "Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders", green nodes are "Bipolar and Related Disorders" and blue nodes are "Depressive Disorders".

Edges are coloured by the number of times the same symptom appears, scaled red, orange to grey. With red edges representing a symptom appearing up to 9 times, yellow edge 5 times, grey edge 2 times.

The figure shows a lot of overlap of symptoms both within different disorders of the same diagnostic chapter and also between disorders of different diagnostic chapters.
